### ðŸ”’ Max Supply

**13,900,000 BRVC**  
_The block was born. We remembered._

### Hybrid Consensus Flow: Light PoW + PoS + Social Validation

Participants solve a lightweight puzzle to prevent spam (Light PoW). Those who lock tokens enter a weighted-random selection to propose a block. A random validator committee then verifies the blockâ€”if valid, itâ€™s added; if not, dispute resolution is triggered.
Idea to implement both Pow + PoS to achieve fairness and sustainability. 

_Approach of token minting via puzzles, public archives, Satoshi clues? More Pow needed?_

More tokens locked - higher  chances of being selected to propose the next block. Fairness needs to have priority or the more tokens the better? % approach? (0.01% gives 1 point 0,1% 2 points...)
