BRVC Coin

A proprietary coin, solely for the BRVC org

_The block was born. We remembered._

### Hybrid Consensus Flow: Light PoW + PoS + Social Validation

Participants solve a lightweight puzzle to prevent spam (Light PoW). Those who lock tokens enter a weighted-random selection to propose a block. A random validator committee then verifies the blockâ€”if valid, itâ€™s added; if not, dispute resolution is triggered.
Idea to implement both Pow + PoS to achieve fairness and sustainability. 

_Approach of token minting via puzzles, public archives, Satoshi clues? More Pow needed?_

More tokens locked - higher  chances of being selected to propose the next block. Fairness needs to have priority or the more tokens the better? % approach? (0.01% gives 1 point 0,1% 2 points...)


THIS IS JUST TEST, NON-PRODUCTION-READY CODE FOR NOW

## BRVC Coin: Conceptual Outline and Pseudocode

**Coin Name:** BRVC
**Max Supply Cap:** 13,900,000 BRVC
**Blockchain Type:** Custom, permissionless (though initial distribution has unique access mechanisms)
**Core Idea:** Genesis Stake (PoS forged in PoW Ritual)

### 1\. Core Data Structures

#### 1.1. `Transaction`

```
struct Transaction {
    id: String, // Unique transaction identifier
    sender_address: Address,
    receiver_address: Address,
    amount: U64,
    timestamp: U64,
    signature: Signature,
    // For puzzle-based minting transactions
    puzzle_id: Option<String>,
    puzzle_solution_hash: Option<String>,
    // For staking related transactions
    stake_amount: Option<U64>,
    unstake_amount: Option<U64>,
}
```

#### 1.2. `Block`

```
struct Block {
    header: BlockHeader,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    validator_signature: Signature, // Signature of the block proposer
    committee_signatures: Vec<Signature>, // Signatures from the validating committee
}

struct BlockHeader {
    version: U32,
    previous_block_hash: Hash,
    merkle_root: Hash, // Root of the Merkle tree of transactions
    timestamp: U64,
    // Light PoW specific field
    nonce: U64,
    puzzle_target: U64, // Target for Light PoW (e.g., hash < target)
    // PoS specific field
    proposer_address: Address,
    proposer_stake_weight: U64, // Weight based on locked tokens
    // Social Validation specific field
    committee_members: Vec<Address>, // Addresses of the randomly selected committee
    // State hash (optional, for state-based blockchains)
    state_root: Hash,
}
```

### 2\. Hybrid Consensus Flow: Light PoW + PoS + Social Validation

This is the most complex part and will involve several interacting modules.

#### 2.1. `Node` (Overall Architecture)

Each node in the network will participate in various roles:

  * **Transaction Pool:** Holds unconfirmed transactions.
  * **Block Proposer Module:** Attempts to propose new blocks.
  * **Validator Module:** Verifies incoming blocks.
  * **Staking Pool:** Manages staked tokens.
  * **Networking Module:** Handles P2P communication.
  * **Ledger/State Database:** Stores the blockchain and account balances.
  * **Puzzle Resolver Module:** (For token distribution) Solves puzzles.

#### 2.2. Block Proposal Process

This combines Light PoW, PoS, and introduces Social Validation.

```pseudocode
function ProposeBlock() {
    // Phase 1: Light PoW (Spam Prevention)
    // All potential proposers must solve a lightweight PoW puzzle.
    // Example: Find a nonce such that hash(current_timestamp + address + nonce) < LIGHT_POW_TARGET

    let current_timestamp = get_current_time();
    let my_address = get_node_address();
    let nonce = 0;
    let light_pow_solution = null;

    while (true) {
        let hash_input = concat(current_timestamp, my_address, nonce);
        let hash_output = sha256(hash_input);
        if (hash_output < LIGHT_POW_TARGET) {
            light_pow_solution = { nonce: nonce, hash: hash_output };
            break;
        }
        nonce++;
        // Implement a timeout or difficulty adjustment for Light PoW to ensure it's "light"
        if (nonce > MAX_LIGHT_POW_ATTEMPTS_PER_CYCLE) {
            return; // Failed to solve Light PoW in time for this cycle
        }
    }

    // Phase 2: PoS + Random Selection (Proposer Election)
    // Only nodes that solved the Light PoW are eligible for PoS selection.
    // Selection is weighted by staked tokens.

    let eligible_proposers = get_nodes_that_solved_light_pow_in_this_round();
    let total_staked_tokens = sum_of_staked_tokens(eligible_proposers);

    // Calculate "points" for each staker for weighted random selection
    // Example: (staked_tokens / total_staked_tokens) * 10000 (scaled for randomness)
    // Or, as per user's idea: (staked_tokens * 0.01%) = 1 point, (staked_tokens * 0.1%) = 2 points
    // This implies a logarithmic or step-function approach for fairness.

    let proposer_selection_pool = [];
    for (node in eligible_proposers) {
        let points = calculate_staking_points(node.staked_tokens); // Implement your % approach here
        for (i = 0; i < points; i++) {
            proposer_selection_pool.add(node.address);
        }
    }

    let selected_proposer_address = random_choice(proposer_selection_pool);

    if (selected_proposer_address != my_address) {
        return; // This node was not selected to propose the block
    }

    // This node IS the chosen proposer.
    // Phase 3: Block Construction
    let transactions_for_block = select_transactions_from_pool(); // Prioritize high-fee transactions
    let new_block_header = construct_block_header(
        prev_block_hash,
        transactions_for_block,
        my_address,
        my_staked_weight, // Or points
        light_pow_solution.nonce,
        light_pow_solution.hash
    );

    let new_block = {
        header: new_block_header,
        transactions: transactions_for_block,
        validator_signature: sign_block(new_block_header, my_private_key),
    };

    // Phase 4: Committee Selection (Social Validation)
    // A random committee of validators is chosen from the current active stakers.
    let active_stakers = get_active_stakers(); // Those who are currently staking above a minimum threshold
    let validator_committee = select_random_committee(active_stakers, COMMITTEE_SIZE);

    // The proposed block is broadcast to the selected committee.
    broadcast_block_to_committee(new_block, validator_committee);
}
```

#### 2.3. Block Validation and Committee Resolution

```pseudocode
function ValidateBlock(received_block) {
    // 1. Verify Block Structure and Signatures
    if (!verify_block_header_hash(received_block.header)) { return false; }
    if (!verify_merkle_root(received_block.header.merkle_root, received_block.transactions)) { return false; }
    if (!verify_signature(received_block.validator_signature, received_block.header.proposer_address, received_block.header)) { return false; }

    // 2. Verify Light PoW
    if (!verify_light_pow(received_block.header.nonce, received_block.header.puzzle_target)) { return false; }

    // 3. Verify Transactions
    for (tx in received_block.transactions) {
        if (!verify_transaction_signature(tx)) { return false; }
        if (!verify_transaction_funds(tx)) { return false; } // Check sender has enough balance
        // Additional checks for puzzle-based minting transactions
        if (tx.type == "mint_puzzle_solution") {
            if (!verify_puzzle_solution(tx.puzzle_id, tx.puzzle_solution_hash)) { return false; }
            if (!is_puzzle_unsolved(tx.puzzle_id)) { return false; } // Ensure puzzle hasn't been solved already
        }
    }

    // 4. PoS-based Proposer Check (optional, mostly handled by selection)
    // Ensure the proposer was eligible based on their stake at the time of proposal.

    // 5. Committee Validation (Social Validation)
    // If this node is part of the committee for this block:
    if (my_address in received_block.header.committee_members) {
        if (all_checks_passed) {
            sign_block_as_committee_member(received_block.header, my_private_key);
            send_signature_to_proposer_or_network(my_signature);
        } else {
            trigger_dispute_resolution(received_block); // Block is invalid
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true; // Block passed local validation, waiting for committee consensus
}

function ProcessCommitteeSignatures(block_with_signatures) {
    let required_signatures = COMMITTEE_SIZE * MAJORITY_THRESHOLD_PERCENTAGE; // e.g., 67%
    let valid_signatures_count = 0;

    for (signature in block_with_signatures.committee_signatures) {
        if (verify_signature(signature, committee_member_address, block_with_signatures.header)) {
            valid_signatures_count++;
        }
    }

    if (
